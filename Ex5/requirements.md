# Exercise 5: Q1 2026 Board Presentation

## Weight: 20% | Max Marks: 20 | Deliverable: Ex5_BoardPresentation.pdf (exactly 3 slides)

## Scenario
Preparing materials for the Q1 2026 board meeting of Spotify. The board (in our case, the Investors) meets next week and needs a concise update on issues requiring their attention right now. Focus on challenges and opportunities from the most recent quarter, not historical issues or long-term strategy.

## Task
Create a 3-slide executive presentation for Investors (our assigned stakeholder based on Investor/Shareholder lens).

## Required Slide Structure

### Slide 1: Current Quarter Snapshot
- Most recent quarter position
- 3 key metrics vs prior quarter
- One headline message about where we are NOW

### Slide 2: Immediate Issues Requiring Investor Attention
- 2-3 issues from the last 90 days that need discussion this meeting
- With evidence and impact quantification

### Slide 3: Recommended Actions for Q1-Q2 2026
- Prioritised actions with specific timelines
- Expected outcomes in the next 90-180 days

## Requirements
- Professional visual design (consistent styling, readable fonts, appropriate use of colour)
- NO MORE than 50 words per slide in body text (use visuals, not walls of text)
- Must include at least one data visualisation across the 3 slides
- All issues and recommendations must be grounded in the last 90 days
- Appropriate for a 5-minute verbal presentation (though you will not present)
- Content must ADD VALUE beyond Exercise 2 - distil and prioritise, don't simply repeat

## Marking Criteria
| Criterion | Marks |
|-----------|-------|
| Currency and relevance of issues (must be verifiably recent) | 7 |
| Visual design quality and executive appropriateness | 5 |
| Evidence-based content with specific dates/sources | 4 |
| Alignment with assigned lens (Investor/Shareholder) | 4 |

## Key Differentiation from Exercise 2
Ex2 is a detailed analytical brief. Ex5 is an executive summary for busy investors:
- Prioritise the 2 MOST critical issues (not all 3 from Ex2)
- Add forward-looking recommendations with timelines
- Make it visually impactful - charts over text
- Frame as "what do investors need to decide THIS quarter"

## Design Approach
Create as HTML with print-friendly CSS (landscape orientation, 3 pages). Use Spotify brand colours.
