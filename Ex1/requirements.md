# Exercise 1: Current Quarter Snapshot

## Weight: 15% | Max Marks: 15 | Deliverable: Ex1_Snapshot.pdf (max 2 pages)

## Task
Using AI document analysis tools, ingest Spotify's most recent Earnings Release and Annual Report. Produce a 500-word executive briefing answering:

1. **3 most significant financial metrics** from the most recent quarter - how do they compare to the prior quarter and year-ago quarter?
2. **Single most pressing challenge or issue** management addressed in the most recent earnings call (must be CURRENT, not perennial - something actively being worked on right now)
3. **Specific actions or initiatives** management announced for the next 90 days

## Currency Requirements
- Must reference the specific quarter (e.g., "Q4 2025" or "Q1 FY26")
- The "pressing challenge" must be verifiable in recent earnings materials or news
- Generic statements like "the company faces competitive pressure" without specifics = low marks

## Deliverable Requirements
- Maximum 500 words (excluding headers and source citations)
- Must cite specific page numbers, earnings call timestamps, or news sources with dates
- Must include a "Sources & AI Tools Used" footer (screenshots optional)

## Marking Criteria
| Criterion | Marks |
|-----------|-------|
| Accuracy of current-quarter metrics | 5 |
| Currency and specificity of identified challenge (must be verifiably recent) | 5 |
| Quality of synthesis and AI tool documentation | 5 |
