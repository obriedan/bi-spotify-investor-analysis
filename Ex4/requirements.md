# Exercise 4: Prompt Engineering Showcase

## Weight: 10% | Max Marks: 10 | Deliverable: Ex4_Prompts.pdf (max 3 pages)

## Task
Demonstrate prompt engineering skill by completing Option B: The Multi-Step Orchestration.

## Option B: Multi-Step Orchestration
Document a 3-step prompt chain where each output feeds into the next to produce insight about a current issue facing Spotify. Show all 3 prompts, the outputs, and explain the orchestration logic.

## Planned Prompt Chain
1. **Prompt 1 (Extract)**: Transform raw financial data from Spotify's most recent earnings release into a structured analysis of key investor metrics
2. **Prompt 2 (Analyse)**: Using the output from step 1, identify the single biggest risk/opportunity an institutional GARP investor should focus on for the next 12 months
3. **Prompt 3 (Recommend)**: Using the risk/opportunity from step 2, draft a concise investment recommendation with specific action items and expected outcomes

## Deliverable Structure (3 pages max)
- Page 1: Prompt 1 + its output + brief annotation
- Page 2: Prompt 2 + its output + brief annotation
- Page 3: Prompt 3 + its output + reflection on:
  - How the chain improved output quality vs a single prompt
  - What the orchestration logic achieved
  - Self-awareness of limitations

## Marking Criteria
| Criterion | Marks |
|-----------|-------|
| Prompt sophistication and clarity | 4 |
| Output quality achieved | 3 |
| Quality of reflection and self-awareness | 3 |

## Key Points for High Marks
- Show that each prompt genuinely builds on the previous output (not 3 independent prompts)
- Demonstrate refinement - the final output should be measurably better than what a single prompt would produce
- Reflection should be honest about what worked and what didn't
- Show human judgment in how you designed and iterated the chain
