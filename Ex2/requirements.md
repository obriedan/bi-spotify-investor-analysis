# Exercise 2: Strategic Issues Brief

## Weight: 25% | Max Marks: 25 | Deliverable: Ex2_IssuesBrief.pdf (max 4 pages)

## Task
Adopt the Investor/Shareholder analytical lens. Prepare a strategic issues brief identifying and analysing challenges Spotify is facing RIGHT NOW - issues that have emerged or intensified in the last 90 days.

## Brief Must Include

### 1. Three Current Issues (Investor/Shareholder relevant)
For each issue:
- Supported by evidence from the last 90 days (earnings call quotes with timestamps, news articles with dates, management statements)
- Specific date or quarter when the issue emerged or was acknowledged
- A direct quote or citation from earnings materials, SEC filings, or dated news
- Explanation of why this is a NOW issue, not an ongoing concern

### 2. Impact Assessment
For each issue, quantify the potential financial or operational impact. Use specific numbers (e.g., "$500M revenue at risk" not "significant revenue impact")

### 3. Peer Comparison
How are 1-2 competitors (Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Tidal) handling similar challenges? Are they ahead or behind Spotify?

### 4. Recommended Actions
For each issue, provide 1 specific, actionable recommendation that could realistically be discussed at a board meeting this quarter.

## Currency Requirements
Each of the 3 issues must include:
- A specific date or quarter when the issue emerged or was acknowledged
- A direct quote or citation from earnings materials, SEC filings, or dated news
- Explanation of why this is an issue NOW, as opposed to an ongoing concern

## Deliverable Requirements
- Must include data visualisations (charts/tables): minimum 2
- Must cite specific sources with dates (not just "annual report" but "20-F p.47" or "Q4 earnings call, 32:15")

## Marking Criteria
| Criterion | Marks |
|-----------|-------|
| Currency and verifiability of issues (must be from last 90 days) | 8 |
| Quality of impact quantification | 6 |
| Actionability and realism of recommendations | 6 |
| Data visualisation and peer comparison quality | 5 |

## Investor Persona Note
Include full assumptions box at start:
- Fund type: Mid-cap GARP equity fund
- Investment thesis: Evaluating SPOT profitability durability
- Risk tolerance: Moderate
- Time horizon: 12-24 months

Frame all issues through: What does this mean for the investment thesis? Should we maintain, increase, or reduce our SPOT position?
